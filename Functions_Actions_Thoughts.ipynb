    "If we keep the AMM at $100,000 but we prolong the competition and continually engage like a funding ladder, the hypothesis would be that this would result in more trading throughout any single compeetition, allowing for the recooperation of the amount spent to intialize the ecosystem. A competition that last a year versus a month should have more trading volume in totality, even if the amount spent to intialize the AMM is the same"
